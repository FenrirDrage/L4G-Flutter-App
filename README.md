# L4G-Flutter-App 🎮📱

**Lookin 4 Gamers (L4G)** is an app designed to help introverted people find others to play online or offline games with. Whether you're looking for a casual game partner or someone to team up with in your favorite game, this app connects you with fellow gamers!

The app is built using **Flutter** and integrates with an API for CRUD user account and event management. It uses a remote MongoDB database (provided by the professor, but it may no longer be operational).

This project was developed in collaboration with [xbeatrix](https://github.com/xbeatrix).
